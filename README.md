# Attribute-Prediction

Attribute Predicton using Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (Cross-Covariance Operator) on aPascal/aYahoo dataset.

"Hilbert-Schmist Norm of the Cross-Covariance operator" is proposed as an independence criterion in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The criterion is used to measure the dependence between the two multivariate random variables. Details can be found here.
